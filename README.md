# code-refactor
Repository for homework assignment 1, Code Refactor.

For this assignment, I was tasked to refactor an existing webpage's code and update it to meet current HTML standards for SEO and accessibility improvements. When I first looked at the code, it contained many "div" tags, a stylesheet with its selectors in an arbitrary order along with some redundant code, and no alt text for the images. I replaced the div tags with more descriptive wrapping tags such as <article> and <figure> where appropriate, added a short, descriptive title, wrote alt text for all the images, re-ordered the CSS sheet so that each selector is defined in the order that it appears in the html document, slightly reduced the redundancy of the CSS code thanks to Patrick Ceriale's help, and then wrote this ReadMe explaining what I have done. Working on this website gave me bad flashbacks to my time working as a "thought-leading" digital trends writer for companies such as Horiseon, and I thank the Trilogy team for that.
